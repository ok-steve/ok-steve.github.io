  <h1 class="text-center">Bio</h1>

  <p>I began my library journey as a student of the University of Michigan School of Information where I focused my studies on digital archiving and programming. I have a particular interest in user experience.</p>
  <p>I currently work at the Catholic University of America where I oversee all aspects of our library&rsquo;s web presence. I have been involved with a number of web development projects, a small portion of which are mentioned above.
  <p>Previously, I earned a degree in music, which I am fortunate to be able to use playing tuba in a local <a href="http://gogosymphony.com">go-go symphony</a>.</p>
