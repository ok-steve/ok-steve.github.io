    <p>I begin my library journey as a student of the University of Michigan School of Information where I focused my studies on digital archiving and programming. I have a particular interest in usability.</p>
    <p>I currently work as the Catholic University of America where I oversee all aspects of our library&rsquo;s web presence. I have been involved with a number of web develop projects, including creating a unified responsive theme for most of our public sites.
    <p>I previously earned a degree in music and play the tuba in a local go-go band.</p>
