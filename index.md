I'm an information professional who develops software and plays the tuba. I'm continuously trying to increase the nerdiness in my life.

I began my library journey as a student of the University of Michigan School of Information where I focused my studies on digital archiving and programming. I have a particular interest in user experience.

I currently work at the Catholic University of America where I oversee all aspects of our library's web presence. I have been involved with a number of web development projects, a small portion of which are mentioned above.

Previously, I earned a degree in music, which I am fortunate to be able to use playing tuba in a local [go-go symphony](http://gogosymphony.com).
