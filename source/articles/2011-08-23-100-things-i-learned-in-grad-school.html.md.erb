So, I recently got my masters degree from the University of Michigan School of Information. It's a very busy program and for the most part you have to just put your head down and focus on doing your work on time. Now that it's been practically an entire summer since I graduated I've had time to think: "What exactly did I learn in the past two years?". So, I decided to make a list, 5 things from each class I took plus 5 from work plus 5 others. My list contains things I was taught as well as things I just learned.


### SI 500: Information in Social Systems

1. People, information, and technology: the holy trinity of SI

### MUSICOL 506: Music and Media

- Translate, transform, and transport: three ways media influences music

1. Google AppEngine
1. Web accessibility
1. Object Oriented Programming
1. You can make money online: using Google, but you probably won't make much unless you post videos of cats

1. Most everything in the news can be tied back to records

{: start="51" }

### SI 639: Web Archiving

1. Web design practices flow with the economy: Flash was used during the internet boom
