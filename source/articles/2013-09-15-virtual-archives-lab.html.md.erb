I received email the other day from a former professor and supervisor telling me a project I worked on in grad school has been completed.READMORE

[PAVEL](http://virtualarchiveslab.org) was a project "to develop and implement a virtual education laboratory featuring digital access and preservation tools." Essentially we installed a bunch of software that could be accessed through Remote Desktop Software rather than requiring students to install the software on their own computers.

I thought this was a really interesting project and I'm glad it has been released out in the world. You can visit the project website at http://virtualarchiveslab.org/ for more info on the software, assignments, and datasets that were used.
