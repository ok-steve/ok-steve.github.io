I assume you go to concerts, but why? Is it just something to do? Do you go with your friends? Do you go for the energy of the crowd? To be the same room with your favorite artist? What about the music? How does it compare to the studio album? Can you hear everything clearly? Do you hear when "mistakes" happen? Are there bands you actually prefer live?READMORE

Studio albums allow musicians to carefully craft pieces because of the easily manipulability of the recording medium they use. "With the ability to manipulate sound through through such technology [magnetic tape and digital recording], musicians have been able to transcend time, space, and human limitations, and in the process have created wholly new sounds, works, genres, and performance traditions"[^1]. Earlier recordings that were cut onto wax cylinders or discs were virtually impossible to meaningfully alter and as such truly were "records" of the way actual musicians played. As modern studio recordings allow musicians to fine tune their music until it reaches their ideal conception of how a song should sound they simultaneously mask the musicians' innate artistry. Did they really play that awesome effect or was it a ProTools plugin? If we do not preserve live recordings will we ever be able to tell?

Recordings of concerts should be collected along with more "definitive" studio recordings. This may be difficult since concerts are ephemeral and live recordings can potentially vastly outnumber studio recordings. Fortunately there is already a community of fans who tape and trade concerts. Perhaps even more fortunately this community follows several practices that line up nicely with archival and digital preservation best practices. Still trained music and audio archivists, especially those dealing with popular music, can play a role in supporting this community by facilitating perpetual access to these recordings while also enhancing their own collections.

Throughout the rest of this series I shall discuss in greater detail what we can learn from live recordings, what the values and practices of the taping and trading community are, and how archivists might effectively interact with this community. By paying attention to this community archivists can help maintain a vital part of the cultural record that they may not have the capacity to maintain on their own.

### Why collect live music?

Albums may reflect an artist's ideal intentions, but they only reflect one perspective. Through "studio magic" musicians can make any sound in any sequence. However, the technologies available for live performance have different [affordances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance), significantly the necessity that they be operated in real time. In addition to technology performing live differs from studio recording in that concerts are performed in front of fans that artists can see and with whom they can interact.

To demonstrate how the different contexts of studio recording and live performance can affect the performance of the same song we can examine the song *Imitosis* by Andrew Bird. *Imitosis* appears on Bird's album *Armchair Apochrypha* which was released on 3/20/2007. Andrew Bird is a trade friendly artist and recordings of many of his concerts are available at the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/details/AndrewBird). I have compiled every live recording I could find as well as a YouTube video of the studio version for comparison.

Here are some of the differences I noticed:

- Each of the live recordings is about 2 minutes longer than the studio recording.
- The introduction before the first chorus is longer, in part because of the time needed to set up the loops which make up a significant part of Andrew Bird's live performances. However the intro also contains some whistling solos.
- The live recordings also have more room in the solo sections. In the concerts Bird usually improvises a melismatic violin solo that does not happen on the album. Instead the studio album solo sounds like it might have been orchestrated rather than improvised.
- Even though the studio version begins with drums, none of the live recordings do.
- The melody in each recording is sung differently.
- The feel of the album is more laid back.
- There are back up vocals in the chorus on the album, but generally not in the recordings. I cannot tell if there actually were no vocals or if the vocals were just inaudible on the recordings.
- The instrumentation is basically the same between the studio and live recordings. The album sounds like it *could* be performed live as it was, but it never is.

These observations line up well with Katz's discussion of the effect of recording on early jazz especially regarding time[^2]. Like jazz musicians Andrew Bird tends to stretch out in concerts with solos that are actually improvised rather than the tightly controlled and orchestrated version that appears on the album.

[^2]: Katz, pp. 83-86.

#### Capital I

There is actually more to the history of *Imitosis* than is present in these recordings which span about a year. *Imitosis* is actually an updated version of *I* (also known as *Capitol I*), which was released on 4/1/2003 in the album *Weather Systems*.

Listen to how the slowly developed intros on the live recordings more closely resemble the studio version of *I* than they do *Imitosis*.

<%= youtube "8qMORdg8uWc" %>


Finally, listen to this version of *Capitol I*, the earliest one available at the Internet Archive. It predates the *Weather Systems* album by two years and *Imitosis* by almost six years. This recording contains much of the lyrics that appear later in *Imitosis* rather than just the repeated refrain of the studio version. However, significantly this live version contains a different chorus than *Imitosis* and a very different arrangement neither of which are documented in studio recordings.

Without live recordings it would be much harder to trace the progression of *I/Imitosis* from its early form to what it eventually became. And that is one reason why collecting live recordings is important.

### What makes taping possible?

Although the idea of giving away content might seem counterintuitive, in the case of taping concerts it can make a lot of sense. Taping can lead to a sense of community amongst fans[^4]. Also, loyal fans also tend to be dedicated purchasers of artists' official albums and merchandise[^5]. There are several factors that facilitate the taping and trading community.

[^4]: Schultz, M. (2006). [Fear and norms and rock &amp; roll: What jambands can teach about persuading people to obey copyright law](http://btlj.org/2006/06/07/volume-21-issue-2-spring-2006). *Berkeley Technology Law Journal*, 21(2), 651-728, p. 670.

## Legal

Sound recordings of a concert would be considered derivative works under U.S. copyright law with written version being considered the original[^6]. Thus the artist who wrote the song has the freedom (subject to any record or publishing contracts) to give permission to record regardless of the existence of other recordings.

[^6]: [Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. &sect; 101 (1976)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101).

Before the internet communication about which artist were friendly to taping and trading relied on word-of-mouth without documentation. It was not until 1984 that the Grateful Dead became the first band to officially authorize taping and trading when they set-up a taper's section at their concerts[^7]. Before that time, even though it was widely known that the Grateful Dead approved of taping, there was never any official acknowledgement.

[^7]: Whitman, p. 1.

On the internet it is much easier to officially document which artists allow taping and which do not. Sites like etree.org maintain [lists of "trade-friendly" artists](http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=TradeFriendly) which are publicly available and often contain actual email responses from artists giving permission (or not) to tape concerts. Making these permissions publicly available is a much more efficient and accurate means of communication than word-of-mouth since a single message from the artist can be communicated once to any potential taper.

<%= thumbnail "#{current_article.slug}/bird-taping-permission.jpg", "Permission to tape from Andrew Bird", :href => "http://www.archive.org/details/AndrewBird", :alt => "archive.org taping permission from Andrew Bird" %>


It should be noted that taping and trading is not the same thing as bootlegging[^8]. While these to activities may share many similar practices, taping and trading is rigorously non-commercial and law abiding. Bootlegging, on the other hand, is usually associated with illegal (ie. unauthorized) sales of live or previously unreleased studio recordings.

[^8]: Marshall, p. 59.

## Technological

In addition to legal permissions, taping is enabled by advances in technology. Taping and trading could not practically occur until devices for recording and duplicating became affordable and portable enough to take to a concert. Furthermore recordings that were initially traded on tapes suffered a loss of sound quality with each generation, thus limiting the potential range of tapes[^9].

[^9]: Whitman, p. 10.

As technology progressed from reel-to-reel to cassettes to digital audio tapes (DAT) recording became easier and higher in quality. CD-Rs allowed lossless digital copies to be made that did not suffer from the limitations of cassettes and could the be copied indefinitely. Currently it is even possible for tapers (with an artist's permission) to record directly from the soundboard that is used in the live performance. However, even though soundboard recordings may get better quality audio some fans prefer tapes from the audience because they capture more of the crowd noise and experience of the concert[^10].

[^10]: Marshall, p. 59.

## Social

Along with being non-commercial, the taping and trading community has a strong ethic of reciprocity[^11]. Fans just want to spread the music that they love. Before the internet making and mailing new tapes was a significant undertaking of time and resources and freeloading could be a significant drain on those resources which could lead to tapers being lessing willing to trade the recordings they make. Online freeloading is less of a problem because fans can upload a recording once for everyone, thus significantly reducing the [marginal cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) of distribution. Nevertheless distribution does require bandwidth and so reciprocity is still sometimes enforced.

[^11]: Schultz, p. 656.

<%= thumbnail "#{current_article.slug}/sharing-ratio.jpg", "Sharing ratio policy for jamtothis.com showing the required GB one must upload based on what one has downloaded as well as the required percentage of uploading to downloading", :href => "http://www.jamtothis.com/showthread.php?t=3117", :alt => "jamtothis Sharing Ratio Policy" %>


In addition to automated means of enforcing reciprocity, online forums can maintain social pressure to follow community standards. There are several statuses within the trading community: "taper, site operator, good trader, bad trader , and newbie"[^12]. When someone is a "bad trader" they can be shamed publicly on a forum.

[^12]: Nieckarz Jr., P. (2005). [Community in cyber space?: The role of the internet in facilitating and maintaining a community of live music collecting and trading](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6040.2005.00145.x/abstract). *City &amp; Community*, 4(4). American Sociological Association, Washington, DC, 403-423, p. 409.

Seeking and publicly displaying permissions from artists, the availability of personal recording equipment, and community standards that emphasize sharing the work as well as the music are some of the factors that enable taping and trading to occur.

### Similarities to digital archives

[^13]: Whitman, p. 20.

As the following screenshot of a BitTorrent download from etree.org demonstrates, the practices of the taping and trading community align well with several archival and digital preservation best practices despite a strong likelihood that most tapers are not trained archivists.

<%= thumbnail "#{current_article.slug}/metadata.jpg", "Metadata from bt.etree.org download", :href => "http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=543942" %>


#### Open and lossless codecs

The taping community prefers lossless and open formats, in the example above the format is Shorten (SHN). FLAC is another alternative. Lossless formats do not suffer the same generational loss that tapers experienced with dubbing cassette tapes, as was mentioned earlier. Thus files maintain the highest sound quality even though the original recordings happened in uncontrolled environments. The [etree.org seeding guidelines](http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=SeedingGuidelines) actually call FLAC and "Archival Format". Etree claims to be the largest community of online tape traders.

#### Checksums

As is shown on the bottom of the example, checksums are generated for each track. These allow each file to be checked to make sure no corruption has occurred in a file.

#### Provenance

Another interesting feature that can be seen on the example begins at "*First time played". Those abbreviations stand for equipment used from the initial capture to the creation of a file. Etree calls this a "[genealogy](http://wiki.etree.org/index.php?page=SeedingGuidelines)", but in archival terms it would be more like provenance. While the ownership of recording is not displayed, the entire history is displayed.

#### Metadata

Tapers create basic descriptive and technical metadata for each recording. Although this metadata does not follow standard archival schemas and is saved as a text file rather than XML, within the community there is a fairly controlled list of elements one is expected to provide and naming conventions one is expected to follow.

### Conclusion

This series has been a brief introduction to the concert taping and trading community. Even though most of the current tools are digital and editing would be easy, the ethic of the taping community is to preserve concerts as they happened. These recordings transform the music into an experience. Crowd noise is not edited out of the mix so one can get as close as possible to being at the concert without actually going.

Because the taping community preserves an important and otherwise unrecorded part of current musical life, archivists should find was of connecting with this community and supporting it. This might be easier than collecting other kinds of materials because archivists and tapers have many of the same goals and practices, such as free access to recordings and the use of lossless formats. Archivists could provide a number of useful services to the community. They could provide a permanent repository for recordings [like the Internet Archive does](http://www.archive.org/details/etree) so that the availability of recordings does not depend on one individual or a group of BitTorrent seeders. Also archivists could provide guidance on best practices for metadata which could help users discover new music.
