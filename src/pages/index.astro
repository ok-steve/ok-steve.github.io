  <p>
    I develop software and play the tuba. I&rsquo;m continuously trying to
    increase the nerdiness in my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the last decade I&rsquo;ve worked as a Drupal/front-end web developer
    for a wide range of culutral and educational organizations in Washington,
    DC. I tackle the whole project lifecycle, including creating static
    templates from Photoshop files, creating themes from static templates,
    building functionality through site configuration and module development, QA
    testing, and ongoing maintenance. I&rsquo;m like a jack-of-all-trades,
    master of&hellip;certainly more than none.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I got a master&rsquo;s at the University of Michigan School of
    Information, where I studied how technologies impact cultural heritage and
    the humanities.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also have a degree in music, which I am fortunate to still use while
    playing on the local music scene.
