I'm a senior full-stack Drupal developer with over 14 years of experience. Based in Washington, DC, I have built websites for several local universities and federal agencies, including my current role at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum.

My experience has involved tackling the entire project lifecycle from gathering requirements, building out static templates, site configuration, developing themes, coding modules for additional functionality, ongoing QA testing and maintenance.

I am also a trained tuba player and continue to enjoy every opportunity I have to play.
