2011-01-24 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #1)

So, I'd like to know: Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica? I'm embarking on a project for one of[ my grad school courses](http://musicmediaresearch.wordpress.com/) in which I will explore music in relation to new media. While it may seem like an odd thing to learn I do have a number of reasons for doing so:

1. I wanted an instrument I didn't already know how to play
2. I didn't want to spend any money
3. I wanted it to be simple enough to learn the basics, but not so simple that I could master it after a week
4. I wanted something the should be common enough that I could easily find some tutorials for it online

I considered a number of options including finger cymbals, the tambourine, and the kazoo, but only the harmonica fit all of my criteria.

## **Goals**

When this project is finished I would like to achieve the following goals:

1. Learn how to play the harmonica
2. To develop skills in social media use and marketing
3. To explore the value of the web as a teacher

## **Description of project**

I will search the web for instructional videos and despite my initial question I doubt I'll stick to just YouTube. My guess is that most videos will be targeted as the fundamentals of harmonica playing so I'll have to look far and wide to find more advanced tutorials. Of course I don't expect to reach the level of[ Corky Siegal](http://www.chamberblues.com/) or that guy from Blues Traveler by the time I finish with the project, but maybe I can reach the level of Bob Dylan. If I run out of videos I may try to interact on social media sites.

As I undertake this project I will post videos of myself trying to learn/play/hack at the harmonica on[ my YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/sccherry) and write about my results and reflections right here on my personal blog. Occasionally I will post updates at the[ website of the course for which I'm doing this project](http://musicmediaresearch.wordpress.com/). Feel free to comment with any constructive critiques or sources of tutorials. If I get any good I might even take a request or two!

2011-01-31 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #2/Starting Off)

Here is my first video, demonstrating my lack of harmonica skills. I had quite a bit of difficulty just figuring out the setup and downloading the right free software to make a video that will upload correctly to YouTube.

With the equipment I had on hand, a computer with a not particularly fast processor and a webcam, the video is certainly not a high quality production, but it gets the job done.

2011-02-03 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #3/First Lesson)

This post includes the first video of my playing after having actually watched a video. I began with videos by[ JP Allen](http://harmonica.com/) because of a recommendation made in a comment on the first video I posted. While the videos were clearly labeled as lessons there was no sequencing to the videos either through numbering the titles or through creating a playlist. This made it difficult to know where to start; I wanted to make sure that I didn't start with a video that built off another. But eventually I had to quit searching and start practicing, so here's what I watched.

### [**Easiest Train-Time Chugging**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_UTJtUI_A0)

I liked this video because it focused on one concept. However it seemed to build on previous videos and used unfamiliar terms without explaining them (such as draw, blow, and nonsense syllables, the arrows in the subtitles). These were easy enough to figure out, but I was lost at first. I also liked the duet at the end because I could hear how the technique being explained could fit into a real piece.

### [**Teaching the Tongue to Dance**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aShaZJBLvW8)

This video talked about tonguing, which was really easy to understand. I use these tonguing techniques all the time when playing tuba and trombone. The hardest things for me are getting used to tonguing while breathing in and using very little air.

### [**Two Simple Chords**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0cLJC6x94c)

In this video Allen talked about drawing (breathing out) and sucking (breathing in) and also using your finger to block holes when learning to make sure you use the correct holes. This would really have been a good starting point because it was basic and explained all the terms and hand motions and arrows in the subtitles.

And now here I am, taking my first steps on the path to becoming a harmonica god!

2011-02-07 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #4/Second Lesson)

In this post I took a slightly different approach. Instead of just looking through[ JP Allen's videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/jpallen7) for more easy lessons I decided to look for videos about a certain theme, in this case a blues riff. I thought that this would add a bit more cohesion to my learning. Also since JP Allen doesn't sequence his videos this approach gave me some way to gradually build my skills by watching successive videos.

### [**Easy Blues Harmonica Groove**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AKOjctNeb8)

This first video was easy, especially after going through the videos from my previous post. It involved no new skills, but basically took what I already knew and used it to create a pattern. However there was an inconsistency when Allen said "suck" rather than "draw", but since it was obvious what Allen meant by "suck" I wasn’t too confused.

### [**The Easiest Blues Harmonica Pattern**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGdOFQ7G-7U)

Even though the title of this video is similar to the previous one, without actually watching both videos you wouldn't realize that they built on each other. Both are about simplified patterns that can be used with Muddy Waters' _Mannish Boy_. In the subtitles of this video Allen has another inconsistency when he spells "too" as "to", which I would pronounce as "toe" if I were just to read it as a sound (I do know how to pronounce "to"” when reading it as a word). In this video Allen coddles his students a little when he has them repeat the riff. At first he counts and plays along, but eventually he asks students to figure it out on their own while he accompanies on the guitar. However through facial expressions he still shows students when to play. I suppose this might be necessary on video because there is no way to tell a student they actually played something wrong. That is unless they post videos like I do!!!!

After watching Allen's tutorials I decided to look for a video of Muddy Waters performing _Mannish Boy_ and was somewhat surprised to hear that the actual harmonica riff was not the same as what I had learned. Of course I guess it was stupid to be surprised that a tutorial for absolute beginners should have different music than a professional recording. However, maybe Allen should have been more upfront about this.

### [**I'm a Man & Mannish Boy Riffs**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ7CCmtyduc)

So after learning my error I searched YouTube to learn how to play the real riff and I found a video by[ HakanEhn](http://www.youtube.com/user/HakanEhn) who takes a different approach in that he includes basically three segments into one longer video. I liked this because it allows for obvious sequencing, but it also made it a bit harder if I wanted to go back later to a portion in the middle of the video. He also took a different approach to teaching in that he discussed the pattern to play and demonstrated the pattern, but didn't do a lot of repetitions that invited the students to play along. This allowed for more utilization of the capabilities of video, such as stop and rewind, whereas Allen basically tried to simulate a live teaching session.

One other thing to note: I really believe some of the instructions were wrong (I discuss this in my video), but being able to see and hear the performance allowed me to catch the error and figure out what I really should play. Yea for video!

So here is what I can play now. Maybe next time I should play with some cool sunglasses.

2011-02-20 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #5/Third Lesson)

So, I didn't learn anything this week, at least not from the videos. This week I tried playing _Mannish Boy_ which was the song that the videos I watched talked about. This was a good exercise because since I had also to sing and play guitar I couldn't devote all my attention to playing the harmonica. Thus I was forced to make the harmonica playing more habitual and less conscious. And as I say at the end of the video, that is really kind of hard.

Even though I didn't watch any new videos I would say this has been the most valuable learning experience I yet have had on my project. I have sat in on a lot of master classes with well know jazz musicians and there are about five things they always recommend about learning to play jazz: practice with the metronome on 2 & 4, learn scales/arpeggios/chords, learn tunes, listen to & copy the recordings of the greats, and get out and actually play. I suppose the same can be said of learning any style of music or instrument.

So, while I didn't watch an instructional video, I used the following performance by Muddy Waters to figure out how _Mannish Boy_ went.

\[youtube=[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxwUOIlqhGA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxwUOIlqhGA "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxwUOIlqhGA")\]

And here's me attempting to play the song somewhat decently. Even though this project is about learning and I don't feel the need to prove my musical skills it was hard not to think of this video as a performance and feel the requisite nervousness. Maybe I could have mitigated that nervousness by watching a video of someone not as good at Muddy Waters playing the same song. Oh well. After several takes I quit caring about all the mistakes I was making and remembered that if I already could play well I wouldn’t need to learn.

2011-03-13 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #6/Fourth lesson)

Every failure is an opportunity to learn and this time I had plenty of failures. First, as I was preparing to watch some more harmonica videos I noticed that some of my holes wouldn't play. I thought to myself: "This isn't good" and proceeded to try my favorite method of fixing stuff: hitting it. It didn't work.

Next I thought YouTube may be able to help me with this, but alas I failed once again. When I searched for "“harmonica maintenance" the first two videos were both by some Scottish guy whose user name is goinginthepond. He had one[ video in which he found spoons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7E3Ky05d8) in his harmonica and[ another video in which he found rubber duckies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZQhBpvUeS4). Now I didn't know much about harmonica repair, but I was pretty sure I didn't have spoons or rubber duckies in my harmonica, so I decided to just open up the harmonica myself. I think in order to find an appropriate video I would need to know a little bit about what the problem is, but if I knew enough to diagnose the problem then I would probably also know enough to know the solution since harmonicas aren't that mechanically complex. So I was stuck in a catch-22.

Finally I decided to just do it myself. I made sure to keep all the parts in order so I could actually put the harmonica together when I was done. The I looked around especially at the reeds and found some debris which I removed. I also poked at the reeds to make sure they were slightly raised from the base so that air could pass over them and make them vibrate. I have a sneaking suspicion that I probably wasn't supposed to do that, but since I didn't find a video I can't say for sure. Anyway, in the end my harmonica works fine again.

And then in the spirit of other harmonica maintenance videos I created a video that demonstrates that I know something about the problem I was facing, but which you probably won't ever find helpful.

2011-03-20 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #7/Fifth lesson)

This week I ran across a series of videos from[ harmonicanotes](http://www.youtube.com/user/harmonicanotes) called Learn Harmonica in 30 Days. I don't actually know if Erik (the guy who makes the videos) is the best teacher (from what I can gather he's only been playing for a year), but I really wish I would have run into these when I started the harmonica. I like that it was sequenced so I could just follow along and use my time and energy to play the harmonica than to find videos on how to play the harmonica. I didn't have to know what I don't know in order to find the videos that would help me. This reminds me of something we discussed in[ the class for which I'm doing the project](http://musicmediaresearch.wordpress.com/) which is that throughout the history of recorded music people sacrificed quality for convenience (ie. wax cylinders for discs, CDs for vinyl, mp3 for CD).

Nevertheless these videos do at least have a much higher production value than others that I have seen. When Erik talks about tablature there is a popup screen that shows what tablature looks like. Finally he has credibility with me because he indicates that he used YouTube to learn the harmonica. He mentions that the videos of[ Jason Ricci](http://www.youtube.com/user/jasonricci) and[ Adam Gussow](http://www.youtube.com/user/kudzurunner) were helpful to him. I may check them out later if I have time.

Now onto what I learned to do on the harmonica which is bend. Apparently there’s a "right" way and a "wrong" way to do it, the right way being arching your tongue and the wrong way being tilting the harmonica. I tried and tried and tried the right way and on the rarest occasions I could hear a difference. However, I have a big tongue which I already had arched in my mouth; I couldn't figure out where else to put it to bend the pitches. At first when I tried the wrong way it didn't work either, but I realized that if I partially covered the hole with my lower lip I was able to bend the pitches. I think the wrong way is "wrong" because it muffles the sound. However, I found that when I blew (or drew) more air as I tilted the harmonica I could still get a decent sound.

2011-03-28 (Can YouTube teach me to play the harmonica #8/Recap)

Well my project has come to a close and I need to spend my time before classes end (and I graduate!) on other classes and projects. But here I summarize what I've learned doing this project.

### **10. Buy a C harmonica**

Every video watched used a C harmonica, while I already had a G. That meant that I couldn't actually play along to any of the video examples or backing tracks that were made available because I was too cheap to buy a harmonica other than the one I already owned.

### **9. Find a structured lesson plan and stick with it**

This is important because skills can build on one another it is important to learn lessons in order, at least in the beginning. I found myself spending a lot of energy just trying to find videos that were at my skill level. Finding videos individually was a huge time waster, especially since I didn't really know what I was looking for because I didn't know what I didn't know. I eventually came across[ harmonicanotes](http://www.youtube.com/user/harmonicanotes) which is a series of 30 introductory videos that actually have a pretty high production value for YouTube.

### **8. Don't use video alone**

Use anything that helps you. There are several YouTube channels that are related to websites that have more information and resources (like backing tracks). While videos are a great resource, if there's other content out there that helps you, why not use it (along with your C harmonica)?

### **7. No one's going to watch you suck at the harmonica**

While I was making my first video I was very nervous about putting it out. I took several takes until I got tired and came up with something I could tolerate. And in the course of a little over a month the video has accumulated a whopping 52 views and two comments, one of which was mine. So my nervousness was completely unfounded. I had no need to worry about appearing like I didn’t know what I was doing; the whole point of the project was learning, not performing.

### **6. Test your tech!**

Make sure your webcam actually captures sound (in sync with your lips), and saves files in a format that YouTube can actually upload. What I used: Cheese, GTK Record My Desktop, PITIVI Editor to convert and sync my lips with the audio, and convert from OGG to AVI to upload to YouTube.

### **5. Don't be afraid to take the harmonica apart**

A few reeds on my harmonica stopped working in the middle of my project. Thinking that I could use YouTube to teach myself harmonica repair the way I was using it to learn to play I began looking for videos. Unfortunately the repair videos I found were either specific to certain brands of harmonicas or just not relevant to the problem I was having. I found no basic harmonica repair and maintenance videos, so I just took apart my harmonica and started jiggling and blowing on stuff. The harmonica isn't that mechanically complicated, mine had four screws and five more pieces arranged like a sandwich. Just keep things laid out in order and putting the instrument back together will be easy.

### **4. Try to play real songs**

One of the hardest videos I made was when I recorded _Mannish Boy_. I didn't actually learn anything new for that video that I hadn’t done in previous videos. However, since it was a "performance" I spent more time trying to refine my planing which really reinforced what I was learning more than just hacking could do.

### **3. If you can, interact with people**

There are other YouTube users that were recommended to me; that's how I found most of the videos I watched. I didn't have time to check all of them out, but I would use this list if I did have more time:

* [KudzuRunner](http://www.youtube.com/user/KudzuRunner)
* [jasonricci](http://www.youtube.com/user/jasonricci)
* [jpallen7](http://www.youtube.com/user/jpallen7)
* [harmonicamasterclass](http://www.youtube.com/user/harmonicamasterclass)
* [RonnieShellist](http://www.youtube.com/user/RonnieShellist)
* [12gagedan](http://www.youtube.com/user/12gagedan)
* [PaulLennonUK](http://www.youtube.com/user/PaulLennonUK)

### **2. No, you won't actually be as good as Bob Dylan in 7 weeks**

At the start of the projec I said I thought I could learn to play the harmonica better than Bob Dylan by the end of my project. After listening to some of the harmonica teachers play I feel justified in my assessment that Dylan wasn't a great harmonica player. And maybe, just maybe, it would have been possible _IF_ I had stopped having a life and had blown off my other classes. But realistically, as simple as the harmonica is, it does take work to play it well.

### **1. Yes YouTube can teach you to play the harmonica!**

This was my basic question that I wanted to answer. While I didn’t accomplish as much as I had wanted I was able to learn enough to say that I can (barely) play the harmonica, and I could learn more just by watching YouTube videos.
