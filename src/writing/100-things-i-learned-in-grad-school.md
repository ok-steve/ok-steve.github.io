So, I recently got my masters degree from the University of Michigan School of Information. It's a very busy program and for the most part you have to just put your head down and focus on doing your work on time. Now that it's been practically an entire summer since I graduated I've had time to think: "What exactly did I learn in the past two years?". So, I decided to make a list, 5 things from each class I took plus 5 from work plus 5 others. My list contains things I was taught as well as things I just learned.

## SI 500: Information in Social Systems

1. People, information, and technology: the holy trinity of SI
2. Collections, flows, and processes: the holy trinity of SI 500
3. Sunk costs: I brought up sunk costs when telling my dad why he shouldn't overeat at a restaurant
4. Revenge effects: not just technical malfunctions
5. It's important to prioritize work, because not everything is equally important and/or interesting

## SI 501: Contextual Inquiry and Project Management

6. Contextual inquiry
7. Project management: yes, this course's name basically described the material it covered
8. Change can be hard, so it's important to be tactful with clients
9. I can do presentations; they're not that hard
10. I should not be an astronaut: which I will never have to do now that we're outsourcing our space program to Russia

## SI 502: Networked Computing

11. Python
12. HTML, CSS
13. Databases
14. The internet was made by physicists and hippies: Tim Berners-Lee is a physicist, Richard Stallman is a hippie
15. SOAP sucks: just ask [Dr. Chuck](http://www.dr-chuck.com/)

MUSICOL 506: Music and Media

16. Translate, transform, and transport: three ways media influences music
17. As technology progressed albums became more artificial constructions than records of what musicians actually played
18. Early jazz solos weren't really improvised: recording was costly, you couldn't afford to screw up
19. YouTube can teach me to play the harmonica
20. If you post something online, someone will find it in a day no matter how obscure, niche, or wonky it is

## SI 519: Intellectual Property and Information Law

21. Copyrights and patents are supposed to advance public knowledge while balancing incentive to create
22. If you're going to sample a recording you're better off sampling from a motion picture than an audio recording
23. When determining work-for-hire status, if you get a W2 you're probably an employee, if a 1099 you're probably a contractor
24. Under current copyright law the blues probably couldn't have developed
25. Most awesome patent ever: [Method for exercising a cat (#5,443,036)](http://www.google.com/patents?vid=5443036)

## SI 539: Design of Complex Websites

26. Google AppEngine
27. Web accessibility
28. Object Oriented Programming
29. You can make money online: using Google, but you probably won't make much unless you post videos of cats
30. How content goes viral on the internet: it rapidly infects a specific, well-connected population that cares about the content and then plateaus as it runs its course (kind of like a virus!)

## SI 580: Understanding Records and Archives

31. OAIS
32. Most everything in the news can be tied back to records
33. Processing and evaluating hidden archival collections
34. Archiving and preserving electronic music: it's hard and hardly anyone's doing it

## SI 622: Evaluation of Systems and Services

36. Hallway usability testing for a quick and dirty evaluation
37. How to do a survey
38. [F-pattern](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html): that's where people actually look on a web page
39. 90% of people's time is spent on not your website
40. [Heuristic evaluation](http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html): my favorite usability evaluation

## SI 625: Digital Preservation

41. OAIS: again
42. DROID, JHOVE, and NZL Metadata Extractor
43. TRAC: dang, it costs a lot to do
44. There's a need to incentivize the creation of content that is archival-ready at the outset
45. Financial sustainability one of the most crucial factors in ensuring long term preservation

## SI 626: Management of Nonprofit Libraries and Information Services

46. How to make a budget
47. How much I never want to make a real budget
48. A lot of management is common sense: like treating your employees well
49. Teams working on projects are currently in fashion

## SI 629: Access Systems for Archival Materials

51. Archivists' Toolkit and Archon
52. Cataloging standards: MARC, EAD, DACS
53. Controlled vocabulary sources: LCSH, Getty, etc
54. Research is non-linear: archival access should support meandering
55. Don't overthink assignments: if you think you need to learn a completely new programming language on your own in order to complete one assignment, you're overthinking

## SI 639: Web Archiving

56. Web design practices flow with the economy: Flash was used during the internet boom
57. Scholars don't necessarily understand the capabilities of web capture software: archivists can't capture everything scholars want
58. Archive-It

60. How to scope a web crawl

## SI 640: Digital Libraries and Archives

63. Interoperability/OAI-PMH: needed but currently not entirely practical
64. The difference between digital libraries and archives: or is there one?

## SI 655: Management of Electronic Records

71. OAIS: also, did you know that a refrigerator is also OAIS compliant?
72. A record is evidence of a transaction
73. Recordkeeping practices can impact the reporting of results and obscure the lack of real progress: as happened in Houston public schools where there were supposedly no dropouts one year
74. When you delete files on your computer the files are still on your computer until you overwrite them: and even then they may be able to be recovered
75. Sharks have to keep moving to stay alive: be a shark

## SI 658: Information Architecture

81. Follow an RFP exactly: address every part, in order, using the same language
82. Nonprofits need good inexpensive web design work, but not so good that it doesn't look inexpensive

84. Make donors feel part of the organization/mission and they will keep giving
85. Start working on a grant proposal early and make a logic model

## SI 678: Preserving Sound and Motion

86. Humidity and temperature are the most crucial factors in preserving media
87. Media is a system, preservation is only as secure as the least stable component
88. Learn to work with a vendor: it's much simpler than building an in-house digitization lab
89. Nitrate film has better quality but is explosive/unstable; acetate is vice versa
90. The only errors you should correct when digitizing are errors from playback during digitization

## Work

91. Networking is important: from identifying colleagues to work on projects to working with funding agencies (which are not entirely large faceless bureaucracies)
92. Identifying sticky shed syndrome
93. Google Analytics
94. Latent Semantic Analysis: and working with programmers to develop software for Latent Semantic Analysis
95. Book digitization

## Other
