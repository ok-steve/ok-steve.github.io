I develop software and play the tuba. I'm continuously trying to increase the nerdiness in my life.

I currently work as a Drupal/front-end web developer for a university library in Washington, DC. I tackle the whole project lifecycle, including creating static templates from Photoshop files, creating themes from static templates, building functionality through site configuration and module development, QA testing, and ongoing maintenance. I'm like a jack-of-all-trades, master of...certainly more than none.

Previously, I worked as an academic/electronic services librarian---where I also did a fair amount of Drupal development---after getting a master's at the University of Michigan School of Information. So while I am skilled at development I am also interested in how technologies impact cultural heritage and the humanities.

I also have a degree in music, which I am fortunate to still use while playing in a local [go-go symphony](http://gogosymphony.com).
