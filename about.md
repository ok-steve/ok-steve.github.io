I develop software and play the tuba. I'm continuously trying to increase the nerdiness in my life.

I began my library journey as a student of the University of Michigan School of Information where I focused my studies on digital humanities.

After spending several years as an academic librarian I transitioned to doing full time development with a government contractor. I contribute to several projects doing front end development and Drupal.

Previously, I earned a degree in music, which I am fortunate to be able to use playing tuba in a local [go-go symphony](http://gogosymphony.com).
