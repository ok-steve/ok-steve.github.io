My current position involves a significant amount of communication, interpersonal skills, and project management. For example, this year my library completed its largest digitization project ever, using a Zeustchel scanner and digitizing seven collections totaling over 45,000 images. In my role as project manager, I coordinated the schedule between various departments, made reports to the administration, and provided training and support for scanning and metadata creation.

In addition to programming skills, I would bring extensive knowledge of digital preservation. I was the lead on the largest digitization project my library has ever undertaken (~45,000 images), which included documenting metadata and file format standards and developing workflows to move our digital assets from initial digitization through to a preservation server and a repository for access.
