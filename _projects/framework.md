title: Responsive Framework
---

I developed a unified responsive theme for my library&rsquo;s websites.

Additionally, I redesigned many of our public sites, making maintenance easier by allowing code to be reused across different systems while also unifying our branding.

Additionally, I have incorporated responsive design into the majority of our public sites. I developed a framework that could could be scaled across the many systems we use (including Drupal, WordPress, and Omeka), ensuring consistent branding and manageable maintenance. In this an other projects I consistently strive to improve the quality of our code to increase maintainability, clarity, and quality.

Additionally I have independently developed several resources, including an overhaul of our Drupal-backed intranet and a responsive design to unify the our sites across several platforms. The variety of projects and roles I have been involved with has equipped with a significant portfolio of web-related skills.
