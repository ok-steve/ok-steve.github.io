title: Automatic Deployment
---

I used Git to speed up website deployment.

As Electronic Services Librarian at the Catholic University of America, I have pushed to professionalize our development practices and adapt to modern best practices. When I started I pushed us to adopt some form of version control; now all of our projects are in Git and I have been working on utilizing Git to automate our deployment process.
